# log-factory

A little log library that makes it simple to add a logger to your module.

```javascript

import {buildLogger} from 'log-factory';
let logger = buildLogger();

```

# test

`npm test`

# build 

`npm run main`


## TODO

add `release-helper` to the build (will need to be updated to work with gulp 4.0).
